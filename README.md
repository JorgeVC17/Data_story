# Malaria Data Story

Over the years, we have witnessed the consequences of climate change on our society. Think of the rising sea levels, extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and so on. But one of the consequences of climate change that many people may not be aware of is its effect on the spread of certain diseases. In this data story, we will delve deeper into the increase in malaria disease as a result of climate change and explore the consequences of the rise in malaria.

## Metadata

#### Malaria Dataset = malaria_reported_numbers.csv (2020, 1 july).

- Dataset with the reported numbers of maleria cases since 2010. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/malaria-dataset

#### Climate Change Dataset = climate_change_data.csv (2023, 26 may). 

- This dataset provides valuable insights into the ongoing changes in our climate. It encompasses a comprehensive collection of temperature records, CO2 emissions data, and sea level rise measurements. With a focus on global trends, it enables researchers, scientists, and climate enthusiasts to analyze the impact of climate change on our planet since 2010. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/climate-insights-dataset?select=climate_change_data.csv

#### GISTEMP Dataset = gistemp_data.csv  https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/

- GCAG: Global Climate Annual Gaps Filled (Deviations from the global average temperature)

- GISTEMP: It's a climate dataset and analysis conducted by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) of NASA.

So, the GISTEMP and GCAG datasets are important tools for monitoring climate change and understanding global warming. Thus, climate change as well.
